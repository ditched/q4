# Q4
Simple chatting application with NodeJS and PHP

### Some insight...
Q4 comes from a long line of previous versions of QuaqChat, I've considered updating it, unfortunately I've neglected doing so for quite a few months now, and until recently had the change of heart to commit some time to it. I've started revamping most of the backend code as well as the client side code. The primary reason for the update is to apply my new knowledge to what I've done before in hopes of creating a better application. This si something that I do quite often.

Anyway, essentially I've used the same CSS, and most of the front-end code from a long time ago, but as I said, mainly pushing updates to client-side and backend code.
