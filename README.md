# Q4
<<<<<<< HEAD
Updated version of QuaqChat 4.

#### Some Insight
QuaqChat started out as a small idea I had to expand my knowledge on making chatting applications in NodeJS. Since then I've gained a formidable amount of knowledge, and a couple of months ago I'd made the first ever "real" version of QC. It included things like commands and rich text (Thanks to [@jamenmarz](https://github.com/jamenmarz "Attribution to Jamen Marz for Rich Text  and Commands")). I've been short on projects recently so I thought why not give QC and update, and apply some of my new knowledge to it and hopefully make it better. I still went with my old application structure as PHP for authentication and NodeJS for the chat server (I know, I know... it's was still fun though). 

Anyway, suggestions? Send a pull request, ideas? Open one!

### Some insight...
Q4 comes from a long line of previous versions of QuaqChat, I've considered updating it, unfortunately I've neglected doing so for quite a few months now, and until recently had the change of heart to commit some time to it. I've started revamping most of the backend code as well as the client side code. The primary reason for the update is to apply my new knowledge to what I've done before in hopes of creating a better application. This si something that I do quite often.

Anyway, essentially I've used the same CSS, and most of the front-end code from a long time ago, but as I said, mainly pushing updates to client-side and backend code.
